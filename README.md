# About
This project is a conversion of a project from ASU Course SER316 from Java to C# .NET with Windows forms. 
The original project gave us legacy code of a barely working Java Swing project and had to convert it into a bus management system.
Almost all original code from the project has been removed. However project is cross captiable with the Java project.
